## Project Brief: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark

### Background Information

Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. Identifying customers who are likely to churn is crucial for implementing proactive measures to retain them. By leveraging PySpark, we can take advantage of its distributed computing capabilities to handle large volumes of data efficiently and build an accurate machine learning model for churn prediction.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using PySpark that accurately predicts customer churn in a telecom company. The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of 0.8, enabling the company to proactively identify and retain customers at risk of leaving. By effectively predicting churn, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce customer attrition, and improve overall business performance.

### Guidelines

- **Dataset:** Obtain a telecom customer dataset that includes relevant features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, call details, customer complaints, and churn status. I shall "telecom_dataset.csv" dataset as a reference.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset, including handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. I shall use PySpark's DataFrame API for efficient data manipulation.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from the existing dataset that might be helpful for predicting churn. In this example, I will could calculate metrics such as call duration, average monthly spend, customer tenure, or customer satisfaction scores.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for churn prediction, considering the nature of the problem and the dataset characteristics. PySpark provides various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. I will experiment with different models and hyperparameter configurations to achieve the desired accuracy of 0.8.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Documentation and Reporting:** Maintain clear documentation throughout the project, including details about the dataset, preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation results. I will summarize the project findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned in a final report.

## Project Implementation

1. **Dataset Acquisition:** The telecom customer dataset to be used includes relevant features for churn prediction. This dataset includes customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, call details, customer complaints, and churn status.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Performance of the necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset using PySpark's DataFrame API. Handling missing values, performing feature scaling, and encode categorical variables. I will then split the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

3. **Feature Engineering:** I will create additional features from the existing dataset that can enhance churn prediction and then calculate metrics such as call duration, average monthly spend, customer tenure, or customer satisfaction scores.

4. **Model Selection and Training:** Then I will choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm from PySpark's library (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or support vector machines) for churn prediction. Experiment with different models and hyperparameter configurations to achieve a minimum accuracy of 0.8.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Then assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the performance of different models and select the one that meets the project's accuracy requirement.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:** Finally I will maintain detailed documentation throughout the project, including information about the dataset, preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, model selection criteria, and evaluation results. Summarizing the project findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned in the project.
